Blockchain data can't be deleted, and bad actors are using it to store blobs, we want to hunt down the user that has been uploading illegal pictures on the Ethereum Goerli testnet blockchain. We need to find one picture to use it as evidence to take him down. We know he was actively uploading pictures between 2020-07-30 and 2020-08-01.
