#install ida mais pas reverse le bin

msg pb ida :
Database for file '/home/kali/CTF/HTB/STEGO/pusheen_loves_graphs/Pusheen.id0' is not closed. Do you want IDA to repair it?

Please note that the repaired database will be upgraded to
the current version of IDA and may still have problems.
The best solution is to use the packed database or a backup.

lancer ida en root

aller dans option general graph puis augmenter la caoaciter de graph a 10 000
